# Multi-Turn Response Selection in Retrieval-Based Chatbots

Multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots is a task which aims to select the best-matched response from a set of candidates, given the context of a conversation. This task is attracting more and more attention in academia and industry. However, no one has maintain a leaderboard and a collection of popular papers and datasets yet. To make it convenient for researchers to get in touch with the state-of-the-art studies on this task, we did this in this repository.
